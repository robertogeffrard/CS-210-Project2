# CS-210-Project2
Description
You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Techâ€™s clients. Airgead Banking is well known in the community. They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.

What was done well
I structured the code with clear separation of concerns. The Banking class is well-organized, encapsulating all the necessary properties and methods for managing investment calculations.

Areas for Code Enhancement
One area where my code could be enhanced is the input validation process. While there is some basic validation, I could improve it by adding more comprehensive checks to ensure the inputs are within valid ranges.
this would the error handling.

Most Challenging Pieces of Code
The most challenging part of the project was implementing the compound interest calculations, to ensure accuracy when accounting for different inputs like varying monthly deposits. I did this by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable functions, and testing each one . By using debugging tools and financial formulas, I was able to make sure my calculations were correct.

Transferable Skills
This project helped me further develop skills such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Financial Calculations, and Input Validation and Error Handling

How I Made the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
To ensure my code is maintainable, I focused on clear organization and consistent naming conventions. My code is well-commented, making it easy for others to understand the logic.
